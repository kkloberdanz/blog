    Nowdays, most people will reccomend that you "go to the cloud" for all of
    your computing needs. While this advice might work for a lot of businesses,
    the cloud can be pretty expensive, especially for individuals who don't need
    constant uptime for their blog. There's also free hosting options for static
    content, such as github.io, but you may quickly outgrow this approach once
    you start wanting dynamic content. If you don't mind spending a couple
    minutes per month keeping your server up to date, self hosting from home can
    be orders of magnitude less expensive than using a cloud service. It's also
    a great learning experience to find out for yourself what it actually takes
    to host a webserver!

    What you need breaks down into these items. I'll go into detail for each one

    In order to host a webserver, first you'll need a server! Because we don't
    need anything too reliable we don't need to get a computer with ECC, RAID,
    and redundant power supplies. An old office PC will do!
</p>

    I picked up my computer, a Dell OptiPlex 980, from a University surplus sale
    several years ago. This sweet rig packs a first generation
    <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/42915/intel-core-i5750-processor-8m-cache-2-66-ghz.html">i5-750</a>
    from 2009! While you don't want to play modern AAA games on this thing, it's
    more than enough to host my blog! I paid $20 for this beast back in the day,
    but you can easily find a more modern and much more powerful machine on ebay
    for less than $100. This machine has 4 x86_64 cores and a whopping 8 GiB of
    RAM. Let's see how much a similar machine on AWS will cost you...
</p>

<p>
    The cheapest EC2 instance I could find that matches these specs is a 
    c6g.xlarge, which costs $0.136 per hour. Granted, these are much newer cores
    than my machine has, but to reiterate, 3.6 GHz quad core i5 Skylake systems
    can be found on ebay for less than $100, so let's take that as a baseline.
    Also, it's important to note that when AWS sells you a <it>vCPU</it>, they
    really mean half of a CPU, since they enable hyperthreading, and treat a
    single logical core as a single CPU, so in actually a 4 vCPU machine from
    Amazon will really be a 2 core machine.
</p>

<div  style="overflow-x: auto">
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Instance Name</th>
        <th>On-Demand Hourly Rate</th>
        <th>vCPU</th>
        <th>Memory</th>
        <th>Storage</th>
        <th>Network Performance</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>c6g.xlarge</td>
        <td>$0.136</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>8 GiB</td>
        <td>EBS Only</td>
        <td>Up to 10 Gigabit</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
    Calculating out total cost of ownership (TCO) over the course of a year, we
    can find the following:
</p>

<div class="quote">
    $0.136 * 24 hours per day * 365.25 days per year = $1192 per year!
</div>

<p>
    Over the standard three year warenty period of enterprise computer hardware,
    that brings us to $3576. At that rate, you might as well buy yourself a nice
    shiny brand-new enterprise grade server!

<div id="an-operating-system">
    <h4>An operating system</h4>

<p>
    Any modern operating system will do. I gravitate towards UNIX flavors, so
    that's what I'll discuss today. While I'm a long time Linux user, I've been
    using FreeBSD more and more lately for servers. I like that ZFS comes with
    the base operating system, the installer has easy to configure security
    hardening, and it's network stack performance has been blowing me away! This
    guide will mostly work for any Linux distro as well (and probably other
    BSDs), but this guide is targeted at FreeBSD specifically.
</p>

<p>
    You can find many guides for installing FreeBSD. I reccomend looking at the
    official
    <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/bsdinstall/">documentation</a>
    first. I also reccomend literally every book by
    <a href="https://mwl.io/">Michael W. Lucas</a>, and in this particular case
    <a href="https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3">Absolute FreeBSD</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Towards the end of the FreeBSD installation, you'll come accross a page
    asking which security hardening features you would like to enable. Since
    this operating system is going to be exposed to the public internet, I
    reccomend selecing <strong>all</strong> of them!

    There are a few more steps that we will want to take in order to secure our
    server. First, we want to require SSH keys and forbid using a password to
    SSH to the server. First create an ssh key pair on your primary computer
    (not the server!) Next, add the following line to the end of
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</span>
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
</div>

<p>
    Most SSH attempts happen on port 22. If we change the system's ssh port, we
    can block a lot oc script kitties and automated attacks that look for an
    easy target. Changing the port that SSH listens to is security by obscurity.
    Meaning that it is not good security by itself, but it will at least cut
    down on the amount of SSH attempts you'll see from unsophisticated
    attackers. Once again within
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</span>, change the
    line that reads <span style="font-family: monospace">Port 22</span> to
    instead have a different number, such as:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    Port 1234
</div>

<p>
    For these changes to take effect, restart the SSH service.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo service sshd restart
</div>

<p>
    The last step in hardening that we'll do is to enable sshguard. sshguard
    is similar to Fail2Ban in Linux, and will protect your server from attackers
    using brute force to try to SSH to your system. You can install it as
    follows:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo pkg install sshguard
</div>

<p>
    To enable sshguard, you'll have to add these line to your 
    <span style="font-family: monospace">/etc/rc.conf</span> file.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<pre>
sshguard_enable="YES"
sshguard_danger_thresh="30"
sshguard_release_interval="600"
sshguard_reset_interval="7200"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    Then start the service:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
    $ sudo service sshguard start
</div>

<p>
    Now that we've taken the reasonble steps to secure our system, let's move on
    to the reason we're doing this in the first place...setting up the
    webserver!
</p>

<div id="webserver-software">
    <h4>Webserver software</h4>
</div>

<p>
    I'll be installing Nginx as the webserver. Nginx is flexible in that it can
    be used to serve up static content but also reverse proxy to other services 
    that you have on your LAN! By using Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can keep
    a smaller attack footprint by having your other servies less exposed to the
    internet.
